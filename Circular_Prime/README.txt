CIRCULAR PRIME

A Circular Prime is a prime number that remains prime under cyclic shifts of its digits. 
When the leftmost digit is removed and replaced at the end of the remaining string of digits, 
the generated number is still prime. The process is repeated until the original number is reached again.
A number is said to be prime if it has only two factors I and itself.
