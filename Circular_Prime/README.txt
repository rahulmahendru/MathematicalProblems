CIRCULAR PRIME

A Circular Prime is a prime number that remains prime under cyclic shifts of its digits. 
When the leftmost digit is removed and replaced at the end of the remaining string of digits, 
the generated number is still prime. The process is repeated until the original number is reached again.
A number is said to be prime if it has only two factors I and itself.

The main function prompts the user to enter a number and returns the appropriate result message.

Functions:

1. boolean isPrime(int n) : Accepts an integer n and checks if the number is prime or not. Returns a boolean result.

2. int circulate(int n) : Accepts an integer n and circulates the number such that the first digit becime the last digit.

3. void isCircularPrime(int n) : Accepts an integer n and checks if the number is circular prime or not by calling the first two funtions.

All suggestions are welcome!
