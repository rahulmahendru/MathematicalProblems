BOUNCY NUMBER

Bouncy Number : We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing 
a “bouncy” number; for example, 155349. Clearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below 100.

Increasing Number : Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its 
left it is called an increasing number; for example, 22344.

Decreasing Number : Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called
a decreasing number; for example, 774410.

Functions :

1.  boolean isIncreasing(int n) : Accepts an integer n and checks if the number is increasing. 
Returns a boolean result.

2. boolean isDecreasing(int n) : Accepts an integer n and checks if the number is decreasing. 
Returns a boolean result.

3. void isBouncy(int n) : Accepts an integer n and checks if the number is a bouncy number. 
Prints the result.

Any suggestions are welcome!
